    <h3><b>about me</b></h3>

        I'm a PhD student at UTK Knoxville studying Applied Mathematics, supervised by Ioannis Sgouralis.

        My dissertation focuses on identifying and characterizing peaks in NMR data with  Bayesian non-parametrics.

    <p>
        I was born and raised in Aba, Nigeria, and moved to the US in 2015 to pursue a BSc in Math and Computer Science with Jacksonville University, FL.

    <p>
        Most of my time outside research is spent in reading and writing on a variety of topics, conversations and hanging out with people, and pastoring a local assembly.
